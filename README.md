# Flask + Celery + SQLAlchemy Example App

This example app demonstrates how to write Celery tasks that work with Flask and
SQLAlchemy. I had a hard time finding a complete example that worked correctly.

Based on the [the Flask-User-Starter-App](https://github.com/lingthio/Flask-User-starter-app).

## Code characteristics

* Tested on Python 3.9
* Well organized directories with lots of comments
    * app
        * commands
        * models
        * static
        * templates
        * views
    * tests
* Includes test framework (`py.test`)
* Includes database migration framework (`alembic`)
* Sends error emails to admins for unhandled exceptions


## Setting up a development environment

We assume that you have `git` and `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` installed.

    # Clone the code repository into ~/dev/my_app
    mkdir -p ~/dev
    cd ~/dev
    git clone https://github.com/lingthio/Flask-User-starter-app.git my_app

    # Create the 'my_app' virtual environment
    mkvirtualenv -p PATH/TO/PYTHON my_app

    # Install required Python packages
    cd ~/dev/my_app
    workon my_app
    pipenv install


# Configuring SMTP

Copy the `local_settings_example.py` file to `local_settings.py`.

    cp app/local_settings_example.py app/local_settings.py

Edit the `local_settings.py` file.

Specifically set all the MAIL_... settings to match your SMTP settings

Note that Google's SMTP server requires the configuration of "less secure apps".

Note that Yahoo's SMTP server requires the configuration of "Allow apps that use less secure sign in".

## Initializing the Database

    # Create DB tables and populate the roles and users tables
    python manage.py init_db

    # Or if you have Fabric installed:
    fab init_db


## Running the app

    # Start the Flask development web server
    python manage.py runserver

    # Or if you have Fabric installed:
    fab runserver

Point your web browser to http://localhost:5000/

You can make use of the following users:
- email `user@example.com` with password `Password1`.
- email `admin@example.com` with password `Password1`.


## Running the automated tests

    # Start the Flask development web server
    py.test tests/

    # Or if you have Fabric installed:
    fab test


## Trouble shooting

If you make changes in the Models and run into DB schema issues, delete the sqlite DB file `app.sqlite`.
